<!-- bio -->
<div>
  <p>Hello! My Name is <b>Muhammad Harris</b>. I am an undergraduate student at Capital University of Science & Technology pursuing Bechelors in Computer Science. I like to Code, Design, Innovate and Experiment. I am an enthusiastic and a social person who loves to take up new challenges and learn new skills. I love meeting new people, exchanging ideas and spreading knowledge and positivity.</p>
  <p>From the moment I printed the “Hello World” in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of programming, But programming was never been “just a side hustle” for me, it’s offered me an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality applications. What started with a simple “Hello World” has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the years go by.</p>
  <p>Since then, I have worked on tons of personal and organizational programming projects. Most of them are based on C++ as it is my favorite language. I have experience with Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, C/C++, JavaScript, NodeJS, React, MySQL, Bootstrap CSS, Tailwind CSS, PHP, PowerShell, Git & GitHub, Python etc.</p>
